Solid is an ecosystem in which people can store data wherever they choose, while still using the applications they want. Such a decentralized approach requires interoperability, which in turn requires standards. Like OSLC, Solid has adopted the Linked Data Platform. An important question is how much we need to standardize, and how much freedom the network gets. Interestingly, Solid and OSLC share the same background and standards, but do we also share the same goals?
