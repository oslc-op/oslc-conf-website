Eclipse Lyo provides a reference SDK for implementing OSLC Servers and Clients. In the first part of the talk, we will introduce Lyo in general and present its latest components such as:

* Lyo Designer as a model-based software engineering (MBSE) approach to modelling and generating code of the OSLC-based solutions
* Lyo Store, an object-resource mapping (OR*M) framework
* Lyo Validation, a library for validating RDF resources according to the OSLC Shapes & SHACL Shapes (presented in detail on Day 1 by Yash Khatri)
* Lyo TRS Client & Server to keep resources up-to-date across OSLC Servers
 
In the second part of the talk, we would like to engage with the community regarding the future of Eclipse Lyo:

* Lyo since 2.1.0
* Upcoming Lyo 2.4.0 release
* Lyo 2.5.0+ roadmap
