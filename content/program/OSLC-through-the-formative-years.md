10 years ago, OSLC was just coming into existence.  This presentation will explore the dynamics that led to OSLC's formation, discussing the threads of technology and community, and how they wove together to deliver key elements of an open product lifecycle integration solution. We'll then travel along OSLC's evolution, remembering (or perhaps discovering) some of the steps along the way, with the goal of understanding OSLC's contributions while absorbing lessons for the continuing journey.
