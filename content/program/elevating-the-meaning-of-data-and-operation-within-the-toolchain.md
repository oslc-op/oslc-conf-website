The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the systems development lifecycle, generating a very good number of system artefacts. Moreover, these artefacts are commonly encoded in different formats and can only be accessed, in most cases, through proprietary and non-standard protocols. In this context, the OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) initiative pursues the creation of public specifications (data shapes) to exchange any artefact generated during the development lifecycle. In this talk, authors present the OSLC KM (Knowledge Management) specification as a solution with a two-folded objective: 1) representation and management of any kind of system artefact and 2) extension of OSLC mechanisms to support the notion of delegated operation. In this manner, it is possible to enhance the exchange of data items and to reuse existing operations within the toolchain. Some practical examples of application developed in conjunction with The Reuse Company will be shown to demonstrate the viability and value of the proposed approach.
