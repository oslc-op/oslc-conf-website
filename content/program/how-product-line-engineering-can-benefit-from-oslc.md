Strategic variant management based on Product Line Engineering has to manage variability information across all (engineering) artifacts. As variability information is highly distributed throughout these artifacts in various engineering tools on one hand, but on the other hand is there is a high dependence between this information, there is a need to easily connect the bits and pieces in an easy way. OSLC provides a general concept of links between artifacts and also defines support concepts to provide the necessary user interface for link management.

We'll demonstrate how this helps with the integration of engineering tools and variant management tools (using our variant management tool pure::variants as an example). We also touch on how the OSLC Global Configuration helps to maintain consistent sets of engineering artifacts for related products in a product line.
