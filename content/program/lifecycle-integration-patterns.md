Have you ever wanted to see how the community is using OSLC in practice to address a given integration problem? The OSLC community is creating a new library of integration patterns to demonstrate how OSLC can be applied as a solution to common integration challenges. Join this talk to learn about the Lifecycle Integration Pattern Catalog including templates and examples. Learn how to define and contribute your own patterns and help the community demonstrate how to benefit from OSLC-based integration approaches.
