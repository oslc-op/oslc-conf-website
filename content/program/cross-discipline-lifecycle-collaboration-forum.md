Today’s challenge is to ensure efficient collaborative development processes while always keeping track of all dependencies within a product. Interdependencies between different engineering disciplines are increasing as products become smarter, more interconnected and feature complex yet individually configurable functions. Pure component-oriented development has been augmented by a functional orientation, where functional aspects of a product are the focal point regardless of whether they are implemented by mechanical, electrical/electronic or software components. Secure cross-discipline collaboration is of key importance for successful product engineering.

While collaboration works well, and artefacts are linked within a given domain, the situation looks different across domain borders: Many data-exchange standards have been evolved to make engineering information exchangeable between engineers of different departments and organizations. Nevertheless, links between artefacts are missing at the system level and collaboration must be enhanced. The prostep ivip Cross-Discipline Lifecycle Collaboration (CDLC) Forum is combining the efforts of users, vendors and research institutes to face today’s cross-discipline collaboration challenges.

The CDLC Forum is analyzing promising methods and technologies in this context by identifying key principles and best practices for cross-discipline engineering collaboration, based on industrial use cases. The use cases discussed are: Engineering Collaboration – focusing on the communication between engineers; Functional Safety – life and history of cross-discipline traceability to easily meet ISO 26262 for functional safety of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functions; Manage Trace Information – checking traces to ensure completeness, actuality and accuracy, and also to store traces that allow relevant attributes, flexible tool landscapes, baselines, variants and configurations. Based on the above mentioned industrial use cases the following questions are in focus: How can Model-based Systems Engineering ensure interoperability between engineers? How can Linked Technologies help to connect the relevant information artefacts throughout the product lifecycle? What do we need for a successful interdisciplinary Enterprise Change Management?
