    "How can we achieve a Google for data? How can we query seamlessly data from different databases seamlessly as if it were in one big global database? How can we establish links between data of different databases and how should we manage them? Similar questions have already been solved for documents by the World Wide Web. But what about data? The Web has radically changed how we find and consume information in the form of documents. The next step in this evolution is a Web of data.",
    "to enable the Web of data. OSLC provides open standards to achieve a uniform interface to different data sources (e.g. different databases, repositories, applications, files) and enable the connectivity of data between different data sources.",
    "such as IBM, Mentor Graphics, PTC, Tasktop, Kovair, Sodius, Maplessoft, smartfacts, and many more. These solutions amongst others radically improve requirements traceability and collaboration in the design of complex systems.",
    "everything about existing and upcoming OSLC solutions, open-source projects and standards. In contrast to a traditional conference, this unconference will facilitate the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants!",
