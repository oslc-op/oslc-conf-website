      <description>This talk will focus on what it means to design and support &amp;ldquo;Open Services&amp;rdquo; and the role hypermedia might play in advancing open systems. Author, speaker, and trainer Mike Amundsen will pose a series of questions aimed at identifying characteristics of open, collaborative ecosystems. For example, what are the pillars of open, interoperable systems and what can the last 20 years of the WWW teach us about what works &amp;ndash; and what does not work &amp;ndash; when creating specifications for an open, collaborative system?</description>
