This presentation will explore the dynamics that led to OSLC’s formation, discussing the threads of technology and community, and how they wove together to deliver key elements of an open product lifecycle integration solution. We’ll then travel along OSLC’s evolution, remembering (or perhaps discovering) some of the steps along the way, with the goal of understanding OSLC’s contributions while absorbing lessons for the continuing journey.</p>',

    'description': [
      '<p>This talk will focus on what it means to design and support “Open Services” and the role hypermedia might play in advancing open systems. Author, speaker, and trainer Mike Amundsen will pose a series of questions aimed at identifying characteristics of open, collaborative ecosystems. For example, what are the pillars of open, interoperable systems and what can the last 20 years of the WWW teach us about what works – and what does not work – when creating specifications for an open, collaborative system?</p>',
      '<p>Drawing from a history of over forty years of software architecture and design, and from more recent experience in creating loosely-coupled, reusable services, this talk explores the reasons why some specifications have lasted decades without substantial change while still successfully supporting unanticipated uses and why have other specifications, while well-thought out and carefully executed, have foundered without long-term positive impact.</p>',
      '<p>The talk will also focus on the design elements that enable easy connection, sharing, & interop and explores what it takes to design-in support for evolvability and adaptability. Finally, we’ll zero in on a small set of properties that successful collaborative systems share and seek to identify what it is that OSLC can do today to better assure success in creating a community of interoperability that can safely evolve and adapt well into the future.</p>'

    'description': [
      '<p>OSLC has gained a strong position in the integration of systems, platforms, and tools in the ALM space, but ALM is not an island in industries that manufacture and construct physical products and systems. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems remain the standard for managing the hardware engineering lifecycle, and the two, ALM and PLM, simply do not communicate well, if at all, in nearly every one of those organizations. Engineering, manufacturing, service, and operations organizations have tolerated the engineering domains being isolated in different practitioner tools and lifecycle management systems for many years but strong evidence is emerging that this tolerance is evaporating and being replaced by a range of emotions that tend to frighten ALM and PLM vendors alike, as well they should. In short, we integrators are now faced with quite a challenge.</p>',
      '<p>This challenge arises from the fact that ALM and PLM systems approach configuration management from two radically different perspectives and thus using very different CM models and approaches. Many attempts to resolve these differences have been attempted over the years with very little success. Whether the approach is to try to use one system, usually PLM, to manage the entire lifecycle and all associated domains, or to integrate the systems, countless projects have failed to accomplish the task. At the root of these failures lies the significantly different CM models of the two systems. If OSLC is to be the best means of integrating ALM and PLM, and it certainly has that potential, the OSLC standard must be enhanced to address not only one of the two CM models (the majority of the effort today seems focused on the ALM model), but both models and in such a way that ALM and PLM assets may be linked in a configuration-aware manner without error or loss of fidelity.</p>',
      '<p>This will not be a trivial task for the OSLC community and working groups. It has been tried many times before in one form or another and the challenge has always been fatally underestimated. Arguably, though, now is the right time to finally address and solve this challenge. The OSLC community can make large contributions to this effort, though such contributions will require much deeper understanding of the challenge and collaboration with the PLM community to succeed.</p>',
      '<p>In this presentation, we will briefly examine a few of the root causes of this challenge and some proposed approaches that may be used to address it.</p>'

    'title': 'Cross-Discipline Lifecycle Collaboration Forum – a linked Systems Engineering approach',
    'description': [
      '<p>Today’s challenge is to ensure efficient collaborative development processes while always keeping track of all dependencies within a product. Interdependencies between different engineering disciplines are increasing as products become smarter, more interconnected and feature complex yet individually configurable functions. Pure component-oriented development has been augmented by a functional orientation, where functional aspects of a product are the focal point regardless of whether they are implemented by mechanical, electrical/electronic or software components. Secure cross-discipline collaboration is of key importance for successful product engineering.</p>',
      '<p>While collaboration works well, and artefacts are linked within a given domain, the situation looks different across domain borders: Many data-exchange standards have been evolved to make engineering information exchangeable between engineers of different departments and organizations. Nevertheless, links between artefacts are missing at the system level and collaboration must be enhanced. The prostep ivip Cross-Discipline Lifecycle Collaboration (CDLC) Forum is combining the efforts of users, vendors and research institutes to face today’s cross-discipline collaboration challenges.</p>',
      '<p>The CDLC Forum is analyzing promising methods and technologies in this context by identifying key principles and best practices for cross-discipline engineering collaboration, based on industrial use cases. The use cases discussed are: Engineering Collaboration – focusing on the communication between engineers; Functional Safety – life and history of cross-discipline traceability to easily meet ISO 26262 for functional safety of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functions; Manage Trace Information – checking traces to ensure completeness, actuality and accuracy, and also to store traces that allow relevant attributes, flexible tool landscapes, baselines, variants and configurations. Based on the above mentioned industrial use cases the following questions are in focus: How can Model-based Systems Engineering ensure interoperability between engineers? How can Linked Technologies help to connect the relevant information artefacts throughout the product lifecycle? What do we need for a successful interdisciplinary Enterprise Change Management?</p>'

    'description': [
      '<p>The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the systems development lifecycle, generating a very good number of system artefacts. Moreover, these artefacts are commonly encoded in different formats and can only be accessed, in most cases, through proprietary and non-standard protocols. In this context, the OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) initiative pursues the creation of public specifications (data shapes) to exchange any artefact generated during the development lifecycle. In this talk, authors present the OSLC KM (Knowledge Management) specification as a solution with a two-folded objective: 1) representation and management of any kind of system artefact and 2) extension of OSLC mechanisms to support the notion of delegated operation. In this manner, it is possible to enhance the exchange of data items and to reuse existing operations within the toolchain. Some practical examples of application developed in conjunction with The Reuse Company will be shown to demonstrate the viability and value of the proposed approach.</p>'

As variability information is highly distributed throughout these artifacts in various engineering tools on one hand, but on the other hand is there is a high dependence between this information, there is a need to easily connect the bits and pieces in an easy way. OSLC provides a general concept of links between artifacts and also defines support concepts to provide the necessary user interface for link management.</p>',

We also touch on how the OSLC Global Configuration helps to maintain consistent sets of engineering artifacts for related products in a product line.</p>'

    'description': [
      '<p>The success of the Web is due, in large part, to its reliance on hypermedia as the primary way to connect and access arbitrary content on unrelated servers along with two principles established at the start of the Web: up-front agreement plus open-ended standards. The up-front agreement of a message format (HTML) delivered over a standard protocol (HTTP) sparked an exponential growth pattern that has continued over the last thirty years. Both HTML and HTTP are open-ended standards. People are free to add new elements to the format and new methods to the protocol without harming existing implementations.</p>',
      '<p>While the hyperlinked document web has been a huge success, this has not been the case for the application web. So far, the wide-scale attempts for the application web have relied upon up-front agreement but failed to support open-ended standards that allow creative additions without breaking existing applications.</p>',
      '<p>However, hypermedia applications are totally possible and, for the most part, quite easy to implement. This short talk will illustrate a working browser-based single-page app (SPA) that uses the Collection+JSON hypermedia format and shows how both servers and clients can "follow the rules" to build loosely-coupled, highly-extensible web applications.</p>'
